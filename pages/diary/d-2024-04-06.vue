    <h2>Sudden motivation to start this stupid journal idea</h2>
    <small>2024, April 6th - 01:20</small>

    <p>
      Right now i am listening to 'Children of the Omnissiah'
      while doing this. Before that I listened to summary of 
      Marcus Aurelius life on Youtube too.
    </p>

    <p>
      So copying old the old emperor Marcus, i am doing my own
      journal like this. I tried to this before but failed to
      keep motivation and writing going.
    </p>

    <p>
      I don't know why, maybe because it is not interesting thing
      to do in the long term? Nevertheless I did this because it
      seemed fun, motivational for me keep up with it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Main point of this is to let future self read it when he is
      truly lost in spirit, purpose and direction in life. I hope
      writings here will re-adjust my true self back to the primary
      goal of my life.

      My wife Deegii (Alison) is sleeping right now. She is kinda mad
      at me for staying up late. So I should join her soon. But i don't
      want to. Major part of me wants to use the motivation I have right
      now to finish this diary entry & keep on thinking about this or any
      other important issues. Otherwise I will just think I wasted another
      few hours accomplishing nothing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tomorrow or today i should say will be very active. Alison wants me
      to go with her to Narantuul to buy some socks and ship them to Darkhan
      by using the train station. While also going to Jukow to see her grandmother.
    </p>

    <p>
      Energy I need and willpower to endure that is big but i will just have to
      convince myself to go through with it. This is just relationship maintenance
      activity so i will have to just do it.

      Thats it for the day. This is kind of easy writing like this. So see you on
      the next entry.
