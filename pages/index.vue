      <p>
        This is a digital journal of Acep. It will be 
        composed of <strong>diary</strong> and 
        <strong>thoughts</strong> entries.
      </p>

      <p>
        Diary is a summary of events, conclusions happened 
        on specified date. It will be mostly about what 
        happened, perspectives or actions from my personal side.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thoughts entries will be more focused on specific 
        idea and its related concepts. My own take on that 
        idea will be primarily the conclusion.
      </p>

      <p>
        If any other collection of entries is needed then it 
        will be added like so.
      </p>
