    <h2>Admitting Defeat</h2>
    <small>2024, April 22nd, 22:39</small>

    <p>
      Thing about defeat is that you don't know
      whether you're losing or winning. Trick to
      it is that if you're in confusion and don't
      know what to do next and what outcome will 
      it bring. If you're in that state then you
      are certainly losing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another way you could see if you are losing,
      is to see what is gonna be the reward for you if
      you win? There certainly gotta be some great
      reward right? thats why you are sacrificing
      things. But if that reward is not worth it,
      or if it doesn't even recover your losses
      then how is this considered a win? Truth is
      that it is NOT. You have made a bad play in
      choosing your battles.
    </p>

    <p>
      So today with this realization, i have come to
      conclusion that i have lost the battle. My family,
      my friends, my future, my soul are all
      hurting. I can't bear it anymore. Now the time has
      come that this battle of attrition has not been
      worth it. The rewards are not gonna justify all this
      even if it is the morally right thing to do.
    </p>

    <p>
      But... I have not given up. I will get up from this
      disaster and focus on recovering. Then later i will
      finish this war. I will be more prepared. Do you know
      why? Because it should be done. I know why I have chosen
      this war and made the initial decision to battle him.
      That person, that evil irresponsible person will be
      punished and I will deliver that judgment when I have
      become the executioner.
