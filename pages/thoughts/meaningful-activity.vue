    <h2>Meaningful activity! is there a point to it?</h2>
    <small>2024, April 6th - 03:46</small>

    <p>
      I don't have hobbies or side activities that i do thats considered meaningful
      to other people. I just watch Youtube and play Factorio or Rimworld. I don't
      even code side projects even though i am a software engineer. But other people
      seems to have activities such as hiking, traveling, dancing, socializing, gaming ... etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      I think for one other people's activities are just as meaningless like mine.
      They just have sole purpose of lifting enjoyment to the person, its a pleasure.
      But watching youtube or gaming for me stopped being pleasurable, but i am still doing
      them. Because there is nothing else to do.
    </p>

    <p>
      In pursuit of productivity and expense reduction. I have refused to take up any distracting
      activities that would take my time. Until today i have reduced them to only these activity.
      These last 2 activity has been real hard to let go of. Why?
    </p>

    <p>
      I think i may have been conditioned to consume Youtube all day. Even when its painful,
      time consuming, no benefitial results. But i think deep down i am doing them because
      its meaningful to me. My eyes, ears and brain like videos that are interesting. It has a
      quota that needs to be consumed on a daily basis. 
    </p>

    <p>
      So in order to have a solution to this problem i would need to first dismantle the problem.
    </p>

    <h4>Problem 1: Non-Benefitial</h4>

    <p>
      Even though it seems like I am gaining information. I am not, it just gets forgotten about
      in 1 minute after it ends. So consumption is not benefitial to me but its benefitial to the
      platform. It is a valuable product but consumption benefit is just going to other direction.
    </p>

    <p>
      So I have to watch videos that are clear benefit to me by consuming it. Like direct solution
      to my problems in everyday like. It still doesn't clear the non-benefitial problem but i think
      it will atleast lower it.
    </p>

    <h4>Problem 2: Non-stop Consumption</h4>

    <p>
      Even if i want to stop, i can't. I physically can't, i don't know why. I tried lot of times
      but i keep coming back to it.
    </p>

    <p>
      I think the problem lies in type of activity i am doing. It is not survival activity, it is a 
      leasure activity. Something what rich people do when they are bored. But i am not rich, ironically
      acting like a rich person by watching videos leasurely.
    </p>

    <p>
      So I have to come up with a way to snap my brain to survival mode. In survival mode, you would
      literally see any activity if it has value to you just by looking in mere seconds. And you would act
      on it. I have to wake my brain from laziness to survival high stress mode.
    </p>

    <h4>Problem 3: When no pleasure</h4>

    <p>
      If i am successful in removing these activities, i would be so miserable. I would need some activities
      like this again just to feel some sense of pleasure. This is the hard problem i don't know how to solve
      for now. Maybe just endure it, or planting some discipline to my brain? i don't know. I have to think about
      it later.
