    <h2>Rage & Violence</h2>
    <small>2024, April 10th, 13:28</small>

    <p>
      There is something in me, unaccounted & longed for. Its more like a rage. I can't remember the time when i didn't
      had this much rage inside me. I think i always suppressed it whenever it boiled up. Because i thought rage is
      emotion that should not be let go of or you will lose rational control. Now I don't think so like that.
      All I have in my mind is rage and a need for violence to get it out.

    <p>
      The other day i had epiphany that maybe sudden depression that i get from time to time is linked to this.
      Because maybe suppressed rage, anger becomes rotten unable to be actualized so it turns into ashy feeling.
      Like a deep sadness and depressive state. This is only a proposition at the moment, so i would need to test
      to make sure.

    <p>
      There is something that i should also mention, i feel tremendous amount of pleasure when i do violence. Its sort
      of like you are getting the satisfaction you deserved. So am i really this late to realize i am a sadist?
      Probably or probably not. But one thing to counter against sadism is that i only get pleasure when i am the
      one doing it. Sadists get pleasure from any type of violence they witness i reckon. But for me i am getting it
      from when i specifically know i am the one doing it.

      There is another aspect that i think its more true. Love for power. Love for powering over someone. I am not denying
      there has been always a part of me that is fascinated with the concept of power. Now I am thinking i may be addicted
      or in love with power. I need it, i want it and i wanna use it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just raw power i think is pulling me towards it. It really is fascinating. Physical power over someone is like a
      good grilled salted meat for dinner. Really delicious and tasteful. No wonder millitary people doesn't like
      to give up their status as millitary.
